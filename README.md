# vue-todo

My first ever Vue JS project! 
It's simple but I'm proud of it because I did it all on my own, without the help of video tutorials, which are a go-to for me. Not this time though.  
And I can already tell this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship with this framework. Than you Evan You!!!!
